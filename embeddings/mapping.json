{"0": "9-686-093 REV: JULY 13, 2006 ROGER BOHN Kristen's Cookie Company (A1)1 You and your roommate are preparing to launch Kristen\u2019s Cookie Company in your on-campus apartment. The company will provide fresh cookies to hungry students late at night. You need to evaluate the preliminary design for the company\u2019s production process in order to make key policy decisions, including what prices to charge, what equipment to order and how many orders to accept, and to determine whether the business can be profitable. Business Concept Your idea is to bake fresh cookies to order, using any combination of ingredients that the buyer wants. The cookies will be ready for pickup at your apartment within an hour. Several factors will set you apart from competing products such as store-bought cookies. First, your cookies will be completely fresh. You will not bake any cookies before receiving the order; therefore, the buyer will be getting cookies that are literally hot out of the oven. Second, like many Boston-based area ice-cream shops, you will have a variety of ingredients available to add to the basic dough, including chocolate chips, M&M\u2019s, chopped Heath bars, coconut, walnuts, and raisins. Buyers will telephone in their orders and specify which of these ingredients they want in their cookies. You will guarantee completely fresh cookies. In short, you will have the freshest, most exotic cookies anywhere, available right on campus. The Production Process Baking cookies is simple: place all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix them; spoon the cookie dough onto a tray; put the cookies into the oven; bake them; take the tray of cookies out of the 1 This case is intended to be used with \u201cKristen\u2019s Cookie Company (A2),\u201d HBS No. 686-094.

Kristen's Cookie Company (A1) oven; let the cookies cool; and, finally, take the cookies off the tray and carefully pack them in a box. You and your roommate already own all the necessary capital equipment: a high-capacity professional-grade electric mixer, cookie trays, and spoons. Your apartment has a small oven that will hold one tray at a time. Your landlord pays for all the electricity. The variable costs, therefore, are merely the cost of the ingredients (estimated to be $0.60/dozen), the cost of the box in which the cookies are packed ($0.10 per box; each box holds a dozen cookies), and your time (what value do you place on your time?). A detailed examination of the production process, which specifies how long each of the steps will take, follows. The first step is to take an order, which will be extremely fast and 100% accurate, since your roommate has devised a method using the campus e-mail system to accept orders and to inform customers when their orders will be ready for pickup. Because this runs automatically on your personal computer, it does not take any of your or your roommate\u2019s time. Therefore, this step will be ignored in further analysis. You and your roommate have timed the necessary physical operations. The first physical production step is to wash out the electric mixer\u2019s bowl and beaters from the previous batch, add the ingredients to the bowl, and turn on the mixer to mix the ingredients. The electric mixer can hold and mix ingredients for up to three dozen cookies. You then spoon the cookies, one dozen at a time, onto a cookie tray. These activities take 6 minutes for the washing and mixing steps, regardless of how many cookies are being made in the batch. That is, to mix enough dough and ingredients for three dozen cookies takes the same 6 minutes as for one dozen cookies. However, spooning the cookies onto the tray takes 2 minutes per tray. The next step, performed by your roommate, is to put the cookies in the oven and set the thermostat and timer, which in total takes about 1 minute. The cookies bake for the next 9 minutes. So total baking time is 10 minutes, during the first minute of which your roommate is busy setting the oven. Because the oven only holds one tray, a second dozen takes an additional 10 minutes to bake. Your roommate also performs the last steps of the process by first removing the cookies from the oven and putting them aside to cool for 5 minutes, then carefully packing them in a box and accepting payment. Removing the cookies from the oven takes a negligible amount of time, but it must be done promptly. It takes 2 minutes to pack each dozen and about 1 minute to accept payment for the order. This is the process you plan to use to produce cookies by the dozen at Kristen\u2019s Cookie Company. As experienced bakers know, a few simplifications were made in describing the actual cookie production process. For example, the first batch of cookies for the night requires preheating the oven. However, such complexities will be put aside for now. Begin your analysis by developing a process flow diagram of the cookie-making process. Key Questions to Answer Before You Launch the Business To launch the business, you need to set prices and formulate rules for accepting orders. Some issues will be resolved only after you get started and try out different ways of producing the cookies. Before you start, however, you at least want a preliminary plan, with as much as possible specified, so that you can do a careful calculation of how much time you will have to devote to this business each night, and how much money you can expect to make. For example, when you conduct a market survey to determine the likely demand, you will want to specify exactly what your order policies will be. Therefore, answering the following operational questions should help you: This document is authorized for use only by Joel Borellis in Sp23 - NEW VENTURE DSGN/IMPLEMENTATN (06501) at UT Austin MSTC, 2023. Kristen's Cookie Company (A1) 1. How long will it take you to fill a rush order? 2. How many orders can you fill in a night, assuming you are open four hours each night? 3. How much of your own and your roommate\u2019s valuable time will it take to fill each order? 4. Because your baking trays can hold exactly one dozen cookies, you will produce and sell cookies by the dozen. Should you give any discount for people who order two dozen cookies, three dozen cookies, or more? If so, how much? Will it take you any longer to fill a two-dozen cookie order than a one-dozen cookie order? 5. How many electric mixers and baking trays will you need? 6. Are there any changes you can make in your production plans that will allow you to make better cookies or more cookies in less time or at lower cost? For example, is there a bottleneck operation in your production process that you can expand cheaply? What is the effect of adding another oven? How much would you be willing to pay to rent an additional oven? Problems for Further Thought 1. What happens if you are trying to do this by yourself without your roommate? 2. Should you offer special rates for rush orders? Suppose you have just put a tray of cookies into the oven and someone calls up with a \u201ccrash priority\u201d order for a dozen cookies of a different flavor. Can you fill the priority order while still fulfilling the order for the cookies that are already in the oven? If not, how much of a premium should you charge for filling the rush order? 3. When should you promise delivery? How can you look quickly at your order board (list of pending orders) and tell a caller when his or her order will be ready? How much of a safety margin for timing should you allow? 4. What other factors should you consider at this stage of planning your business? 5. Your product must be made to order because each order is potentially unique. If you decide to sell standard cookies instead, how should you change the production system? The order-taking process? Other policies?

Anderson Notes Technology Enterprise Design and Implementation: STC 396 M.A. Anderson & E.G. Anderson An Aside on Brainstorming A suggested approach, the \u201cKJ Diagram\u201d 1. Ask a very specific question 2. Get stakeholders into a group 3. Go around group and ask for an idea/concern/answer forthe question. 4. Facilitator(s) put it onto a post-it 5. Repeat until ideas trickle off 6. Group clusters ideas into groups of 5-10 that are similar \u2013 Hint: don\u2019t try to rationalize the groups at this point 7. Give a name to each cluster 8. Determine risks/opps/metrics associated with each cluster \u2013 Use different color post-it for this step Remember at all times that this is a brainstorming session. There is no need to \u201cweed out\u201d ideas. Technology Enterprise Design and Implementation: STC 396 M.A. Anderson & E.G. Anderson Coping with Risks & Opportunities \u2022 Responses: The 4 T\u2019s: \u2013 Treating (eliminating/mitigating up-front) \u2013 Transferring (e.g. hedging, or to a supplier) \u2013 Taking (often with contingency plans and metrics, esp. common with opportunities) \u2013 Terminating (reducing the project scope or abandoning the project as a whole). \u2022 Response plans can be a mixture of the 4T\u2019s. \u2022 Contingency plans must have trigger conditions \u2022 Need a tool to prioritize and keep track of risks Technology Enterprise Design and Implementation: STC 396 M.A. Anderson & E.G. Anderson Notes Technology Enterprise Design and Implementation: STC 396 M.A. Anderson & E.G. Anderson Risk Register \u2022 Risks (and uncertainties) must be kept track of \u2013 The usual tool for this is some variant of a \u201crisk register\u201d \u2022 Not all risks are created equal, so they are \u201cscored\u201d for prioritization. \u2013 Expected value \u2013 Qualitative \u2013 Warning: Some risks could be correlated! \u2022 There is also an \u201copportunity\u201d register (you\u2019ll build one in your homework). \u2022 Risk/Opportunity registers (and response plans) must be continually updated.

Anderson Craft Bourbon Example Technology Enterprise Design and Implementation: STC 396 M.A. Anderson & E.G. Anderson Craft Bourbon Market \u2022 Hipsters/Millennials are very interested in \u201dhand-crafted,\u201d authentic bourbon. \u2022 For your demographic you\u2019ll need to age the bourbon after distillation for two years prior to selling it. \u2022 You will need to determine a marketing plan. \u2013 The market is very crowded \u2013 You\u2019ll need to design a bottle and label design that\u2019s unique, as well as creating a story for yourself that will differentiate your brand in the market. \u2013 There are many ways to market your brand. One way to do this is to buy booth space at a whiskey expo yourself or at individual retailers. \u2022 Opening a distillery takes 4 \u2013 8 million dollars. \u2022 Alternative to a distillery is to outsource your whiskey from MGP and then outsource bottling to a local bottler. Variable cost per gallon sold is about 50% higher, but you can sell it immediately. Technology Enterprise Design and Implementation: STC 396 M.A. Anderson & E.G. Anderson Craft Bourbon Market \u2022 One trick to raise revenue is to build a tasting room. \u2013 People who visit the tasting room can legally buy your bourbon, but you won\u2019t lose the 50% of the retail price to the distributor and retailer. Of course it costs about a $1M to build, and you need to staff it. \u2022 Industry is heavily regulated \u2022 You cannot sell without finding a distributor. \u2013 You need them more than they need you. \u2013 The distiller and retailer take 50% of the MSRP. \u2013 Distributors will experiment with placing your product at select retailers for a trial period. After that, you\u2019ll get shelf space in proportion to how much you sell. \u2022 You also need to get licensed, arrange to pay taxes etc. Technology Enterprise Design and Implementation: STC 396 M.A. Anderson & E.G. Anderson In-Class Assignment: Risk Registers 1. Break up into groups. 2. Assume that you are creating your own startup bourbon brand. 3. Name your bourbon! 4. Please identify 5 risks & 1 opportunity. One risk should come from each of the FuTBOL categories. The opportunity can come any category. 5. Rate the likelihood and severity of each risk on a 1-5 scale \u2013 1=very low, 2 = low, 3 = medium, 4 = high, 5 = very high \u2013 The composite risk factor is the product of the likelihood of a risk (on the 1-5 scale) and its severity (on the 1-5 scale). 6. Identify potential mitigation/contingency plans for each of the 5 risks (based on your risk score). Identify the trigger conditions.

Anderson", "4": "Timing & Recurring Cost Estimation Project estimation fundamentals Work breakdown structure Critical path Padding & Variability Work Breakdown Structure Or? -Roman Proverb Time and Money \u2022 We have estimated variable and recurring fixed costs with the fishbone. However: \u2022 We still need to estimate non-recurring fixed costs (or sunk costs); \u2022 Central problem of project management is partly due to estimation \u2022 We must estimate timing of the project. Planning and Estimation Tools The essence of project management is using easy-to-understand visual scheduling methods.. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Explains exactly what needs to be done The Gantt Chart Simple and easy to explain to uninitiated Critical Path Method (CPM) Explicitly represents dependencies. Enables Time/cost trade-offs Program Evaluation & Review Technique (PERT) Introduces mechanisms to cope with uncertainty Work Breakdown Structure Avoiding estimation biases What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)? \u2022 Organized list of all the activities you need to complete your project \u2022 Details scope \u2022 Foundation for accurate cost/schedule estimates \u2022 Foundation for monitoring progress \u2022 Creates ownership for each activity WBS Example Each activity has a verb and High-Level an object Activity WBS (Paragraph Form) So How Do You Get a WBS? \u2022 Easier to start from top-down, but then start fromlook from bottom up \u2022 Brainstorm \u2022 Interview experts OR Don\u2019t forget planning activities! Initial WBS Estimation Add timing and cost \u2022 Estimation for a project is better from the bottom up \u2022 Hence, adjust the WBS to break up (or aggregate) theactivities into easy-to-estimate chunks (8/80 rule) \u2022 Assume 100% utilization of employees Use analogous historical data if at all possible \u2012Then use logic \u2012Then use 3-point estimation from PERT from experts \u2012Even for CPM Once you do have CP done, check final bottom-up estimateagainst top-down experience/expectation WBS Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts \u2022 Do have AN OWNER who is responsible for completing each activity \u2022 Do not worry about chronological order \u2022 If you use agile sprints, just represent each sprint asan activity \u2022 Living Document! Wedding Planner Exercise Break into your groups and create a WBS for holding a wedding. \u2013 Decide first what type of wedding you want (i.e. your project purpose) \u2013 Each of you first write down what you guess the wedding should cost (individually, no collaborating) \u2013 Include at least 20 activities. Remember to include ancillary activities such asreserving hotel space for guests, planning the honeymoon, taking honeymoon, writing thank you cards, etc. \u2013 Assign an estimated cost and timing for each activity. \u2013 Make sure to use at least four summary tasks and assign a responsible person for each activity. \u2013 Use paragraph form for your WBS. Excel or Word is probably best choice for App. \u2013 Total up your costs at the end. How did they compare? Be prepared to defend your WBS in front of the class as a whole!

Step by Step 1) Determine activities, time estimates, and precedence (what depends on what) relationships. 2) Draw the network diagram \u2022 activities are nodes \u2022 precedence (dependence) relationships are arrows \u2022 Begin with a \u201cstart\u201d node, draw an arrow from the start node to all the activities without predecessors \u2022 Finish with an \u201cend\u201d node. Draw arrows from all the activities without accessories to this \u201cend\u201d node. A Couple of Tips for Drawing Use a pencil or computer. You\u2019ll need more than one iteration You should always add \u201cdummy\u201d start and end nodes. This is particularly helpful: -If there are two or more activities with no predecessors A, 7 Start, 0 -If there are two or more activities with no successors R, 3 End, 0 X, 2 Critical Path Method (CPM) Step by Step (cont.) 3) Perform a Forward Path Analysis \u2022 Earliest start (ES) is 0 for the \u201cstart\u201d activity. \u2022 Calculate the ES and EF for each activity \u2022 For each subsequent activity, EF = ES + activity duration \u2022 ES for an activity = Maximum of all its predecessors\u2019 EF\u2019s 4) Perform a Backward Path Analysis \u2022 LF (latest finish) is EF for the \u201cend\u201d node \u2022 Working backwards, calculate LS and LF (latest finish) for each activity \u2022 LF = minimum of all the successor activities\u2019 LS\u2019s \u2022 LS = LF \u2013 activity duration for all activities \u2022 At the end, the LS for the \u201cstart\u201d node should be zero. 5) Establish slacks (time you can delay activity without violating latest finish ie LF-EF) and the critical path (the path that determines time of project) Technology Enterprise Design and Implementation: STC 396 M.A. Anderson & E.G. Anderson Labeling Conventions ESi EFi i, di LSi LFi ESi \u2013 Earliest Start for node i LSi \u2013 Latest Start for node i EFi \u2013 Earliest Finish for node i LFi \u2013 Latest Finish for node i i, di -node i has duration of di CPM Example What do you do first? CPM Example \u2013 Network Diagram First, we calculate the earliest possible start and finish times for each activity. CPM Example \u2013 Forward Path 0 Then, we calculate the latest possible start and finish times for each activity. These latest times will not compromise the schedule of the project as a whole. CPM Example \u2013 Backward Path 0 Then, we calculate the latest possible start and finish times for each activity. These latest times will not compromise the schedule of the project as a whole. CPM Example \u2013 Slack 0 CP= (Total) Slack (aka total float) is the latest you can delay the completion of an activity without delaying the project as a whole. Slacki= LSi \u2013 ESi. The critical path(s) contains those activities with zero slack. Technology Enterprise Design and Implementation: STC 396 M.A. Anderson & E.G. Anderson Confirming the Critical Path To check whether you have correctly identified the critical path, make sure it\u2019s the path with the longest duration. The critical path always has the longest duration. Duration St-DGHIJK-End = 30 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.3 = 31.2 Duration St-AGHIJK-End = 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.3 = 2.2 Duration St-BCFIJK-End = 21 + 7 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.3 = 29.2 Duration St-BCIJK-End = 21 + 7 + 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.3 = 28.7 Duration St-BEJK-End = 21 + 2 + 0.15 + 0.3 = 23.45 Etc. \u2022 St-DGHIJK-End is the critical path, because it\u2019s the longest! Note are there any paths that are almost as long as the critical path? (These are oftentimes called near critical paths.)

Anderson A Small Issue: Resource Conflicts What is the critical path for the diagram below? A Small Issue: Resource Conflicts What is the critical path for the diagram below? CPM and Crashing What activities might you consider spending extra resources (either thru overtime or additional assets) on to \u201ccrash\u201d (i.e. accelerate the schedule of) a project? Of course, one consideration is that you\u2019d want to spend on the activity that\u2019s cheapest to crash. Are there any other considerations? PERT Incorporating Variance Risks Problems with CPM CPM is completely deterministic \u2013 We cannot make any sort of probabilistic estimates such as a P90. \u2013 If we use the most likely estimate for duration, the CP estimate will be too short. \u2013 Conservatism often tends to create overlong projections (padding), leading to \u201dnegotiation dance.\u201d One way to get around these issues is to accept that \u201cEstimates aren\u2019t points, they are probabilistic distributions\u201d Or in layman\u2019s terms \u201cEstimates are not points, they are ranges\u201d Why do we need PERT? \u2022 Ranges work better to ameliorate the \u201cestimation dance. But how do we calculate appropriateranges? \u2022 Determine how much to pad when single-pointestimates are used. \u2022 How do we account for the benefit of mitigatingvariance risks? Uncertainty in Task (Activity) Duration Probability m mode ba 5% Most 95% Duration Likely 3-Point PERT Activity Estimation 5% Mode/Most 95% Duration Likely Expectation (i.e.mean) = 0.63* m+ 0.185*(a+ b) 2 $ &% b-a ! \u2260 Std. Deviation Note: These are modified from the Variance = \" 3.25 traditional PERT formulas by modern research. If you take a PMP exam, you\u2019ll b-a want to use different formulas! See the OMD book for traditional formulas. 3.25 Standard Deviation = Now we estimate the expectation (mean) and the variance for each activity.. Technology Enterprise Design and Implementation: STC 396 M.A. Anderson & E.G. Anderson Activity Estimation Example You are remodeling your house. The contractor estimates that the activity of remodeling your kitchen has minimum, most likely, and pessimistic estimates of $13,000, $25,000, and $65,000. What is your cost estimate for your expected cost and standard deviation? Cost Example Work Calculating Project Cost Probabilities Now that we have estimates for each of our activities, we can make use of the Central Limit Theorem to calculate overall project cost probabilities. \u2022 Determine each activity\u2019s cost. \u2022 Add all the expected (i.e. mean) activity costs. \u2022 Add together all the activity variances. \u2022 Only then take the square root of the total variance to get the project\u2019s standard deviation. --Do NOT add Activity Standard Deviations. \u2022 Voila, the project cost distribution will have an approximately normal distribution via the CLT. Now we can calculate the probability of different scenarios. Example Mean Duration Std. Deviation Mean Cost Std.

Implications for Risk Management How is \u201ccrashing\u201d different once you account for risk? Which estimate should you give your investor/manager in terms of contingency budget? The P50, the P95, etc.? A Couple of PERT Caveats \u2022 Do NOT use the PERT-like functions in Microsoft Project. They add together P95s for each activity (essentially adding std. devations), thus overestimating project P95s. \u2022 The \u201cmodern 3-point\u201d formulas in this presentation are more modern (and accurate) than the normal formulas you\u2019ll find if you look online or in a reference book. The modern formulas weight the tails more heavily and account for the fact that people have trouble estimating true maxima and minima. \u2022 PERT designed for variance risk management. Need simulation to bring in contingency risks from risk register. Not Perfection There are some significant issues when using a CPM/PERT approach to project management. \u2022 Can\u2019t handle serious technological/market uncertainty well (in this case, need an agile development process ) \u2013 Rapid design-build-test cycles are increasingly more common even with physical products, esp. using simulation \u2022 Use can promote a sequential mindset \u2013 Promotes handoffs & decreases teamwork \u2013 Concurrency is often quicker & cheaper \u2022 Critical paths can change if slacks are violated \u2013 It\u2019s a living document Takeaways Takeaways 2 Timing & Recurring Cost Estimation Project estimation fundamentals Work breakdown structure Critical path Padding & Variability Recapping with Rap"}
